First (tangerine OR trees) because tangerine has the least
Then (kaleidoscope OR eyes) because kaleidoscope is the next least
Last (marmalade OR skies)


1.8 
If the query is:

friends AND romans AND (NOT countrymen)

how could we use the frequency of countrymen in
evaluating the best query evaluation order? In 
particular, propose a way of handling negation
in determining the order of query processing.

If countrymen is really frequent then it can be 
used to remove documents by where it does not exist.
Count for word X is (documents where word X occurs)
For Word X the count for !X is 
((number of total documents)-(documents where word X occurs))


2.5
Why are skip pointers not useful for queries of the form x OR y?

Because you don't limit the number the number of documents with
an 'OR' query. The skip lists would point to every document.
